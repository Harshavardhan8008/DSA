# we can use result = '' empty string 'and' can add it to i everytime but

# since strings in pyrhon are immutable that makes our solution very slow for larger string

# n(n*1)/2 -> it becomes n*2 problem

# so using a list append and then join is best solution

# but there are if list is very large we need to create a list then join might be slow

# but not very slow it is also efficient

# so we are using this iterator syntax which leverage join and also don't create complete list
